When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository for coloborating with other people and also as a backup for my own PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually puling changes allows me to control the state of of working local repository and pull when I am ready with my changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork works only on Github and creates a copy of an existing repository on Github. Clone copes a repository from the source and creates a remote. Branch on the otherhand only works on a local reporsitory and creates a labled commit that has an independent commit history from the orignal it was branched from.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having a copy of the remote stored locally helps you compare your local to the remote even when you are not connected to the internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Collaborating without using Git or Github will be a completely manual process and would be error prone. Using Github allows easier collaboration.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When I do not want to break the master with my changes and only merge into master when I am sure that everything works fine. It is also useful for collaborating with others as we can then use pull requests to have our changes evaluated and only merged into master when required.
