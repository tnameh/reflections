When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository for coloborating with other people and also as a backup for my own PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually puling changes allows me to control the state of of working local repository and pull when I am ready with my changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork works only on Github and creates a copy of an existing repository on Github. Clone copes a repository from the source and creates a remote. Branch on the otherhand only works on a local reporsitory and creates a labled commit that has an independent commit history from the orignal it was branched from.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having a copy of the remote stored locally helps you compare your local to the remote even when you are not connected to the internet.
