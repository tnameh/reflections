When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository for coloborating with other people and also as a backup for my own PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually puling changes allows me to control the state of of working local repository and pull when I am ready with my changes.
