What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository a .git meta folder is created that contains 
all the metadata for the repository. It does not add any files to the repository
at this stage. We need to do this for the folder to be recognized as a git 
repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that you would like to include in a commit. This
allows you the possibility of adding different files for each commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By adding only the relevant files for that particular change to the staging area from the
working area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are useful when working in parallel on the master branch as well as a new
experimental feature.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams allow us to see the parents of each tip and to trace back to the point at
which each branch diverged.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The result of merging 2 branches is that the tip has 2 parents and all commits from the point
of divergence are merged.
