What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository a .git meta folder is created that contains 
all the metadata for the repository. It does not add any files to the repository
at this stage. We need to do this for the folder to be recognized as a git 
repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that you would like to include in a commit. This
allows you the possibility of adding different files for each commit.
